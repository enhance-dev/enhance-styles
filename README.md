Functional utility classes

## [These utility classes follow Tailwind naming conventions]

The difference between enhance naming conventions and Tailwind, Tachyons etc. is the scale starts at the base and travels up the scale with positive numbered suffixes and down the scale with negative numbered suffixes so you know if you are travelling up or down the scale from the base font size.
